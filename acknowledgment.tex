First, I would like to thank Prof.\ Dr.\ Markus Schumacher for providing me with such an interesting topic
for a master thesis and his supervision throughout the year.
If any questions regarding particle physics appeared he was willing to help me with his expertise and knowledge.\\[0.5cm]

Further more I would like my immediate supervisor, Dr.\ Duc Bao Ta for his help with questions regarding physical and technical nature,
and helping me survive in the jungle of ATLAS meetings and politics. \\[0.5cm]

Last but not least I would like to express my gratitude to all members of the group to help me feel welcome in the group
and providing a pleasant working climate.
